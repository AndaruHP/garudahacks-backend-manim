00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,310
Let's understand how five times five

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:04,988
can be represented as repeated addition.

3
00:00:06,083 --> 00:00:10,447
Five times five means we add the number five, five times.

4
00:00:21,533 --> 00:00:25,633
And when we add them all together, the result is twenty five.
